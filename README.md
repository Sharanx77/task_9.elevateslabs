# 🛡️ ValidEx | Secure Validation Suite - Task 9

**A robust, client-side form validation interface featuring Glassmorphism UI, real-time feedback, and regular expression security patterns.**

### 🔴 **Live Demo:** [Click Here to View](https://sharanx77.github.io/task_9.elevateslabs/)

This project was developed as part of the **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship (Task 9)**. It demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript Event Handling, Regular Expressions (Regex), and DOM Manipulation, wrapped in a professional "Developer Portfolio" interface.

## 🚀 About The Project

**"ValidEx"** is not just a form; it is a demonstration of secure frontend practices. Designed with a **Security-first mindset**, it completely bypasses default HTML5 validation to implement custom, logic-driven checks. It serves as a template for secure user registration systems.

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Custom Regex Patterns:** Robust validation logic for Emails, Usernames, and Complex Passwords.
* **Real-Time Feedback:** Utilizing 'debounce' techniques to provide instant visual cues without performance lag.
* **Dynamic Password Strength:** A visual meter that calculates and displays password complexity (Weak/Medium/Strong) in real-time.
* **Cross-Field Dependency:** Logic that links "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields to ensure data integrity.
* **Glassmorphism UX:** A floating modal design with blur effects and smooth CSS transitions.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project fulfills the requirements of **Task 9: Client-Side Form Validation Using JavaScript**:
1.  **Regex Implementation:** Created specific patterns to enforce email structure (`user@domain.ext`) and password complexity (Uppercase, Number, Symbol).
2.  **Event Handling:** Used `event.preventDefault()` to intercept form submission and `keyup` listeners for immediate user feedback.
3.  **Performance Optimization:** Implemented a **Debounce function** to limit validation calls during rapid typing, enhancing performance.
4.  **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically toggles CSS classes (`.success` / `.error`) to alter borders and visibility of error messages.
